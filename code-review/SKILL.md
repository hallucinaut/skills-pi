# Code Review Skill

Comprehensive code analysis focusing on quality, security, performance, and best practices.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- Review code for bugs and logical errors
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Evaluate code quality and maintainability
- Optimize performance
- Check adherence to best practices
- Generate code quality reports

## Review Areas

- SQL injection risks
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization gaps
- Sensitive data exposure
- Dependency vulnerabilities

### Code Quality
- Code organization and modularity
- Naming conventions
- DRY principle adherence
- Error handling
- Testing coverage

### Performance
